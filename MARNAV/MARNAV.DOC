                            MARNAV 2.2 DOCUMENTATION
         
                                   SECTION I
         
                                  INTRODUCTION
         
              There is an increasing need for software which will convert
         Latitude/Longitude  data  to  LORAN-C  delay   coordinates   and
         vice-versa  for  the  purpose of adding LORAN-C data to the many
         charts and maps, both land and marine which are published  with-
         out  this  information.  In  addition  to  the  LORAN-Geographic
         conversion, MARNAV also provides  a  means  of  calculating  all
         delays  for a given geographic location thus allowing a shift to
         another slave in the event of technical difficulty or as a means
         of double checking a position.
         
              All  LORAN-C  Chains  for which data is currently available
         have been included in MARNAV. The chain data used  is  based  on
         information  from  the  UNITED STATES COAST GUARD, Department of
         Transportation as published in COMDTINST-M16562.3 (Old CG-462).
         
              The following constants were used for all algorithms in the
         MARNAV Program. Signal propagation velocity used is the velocity
         of light in free space 299,792,458 meters/sec.., sea water  con-
         ductivity  5.0  mhos/meter,  0.01745329251993889 radians/degree.
         All calculations and data in double precision. Calculations nec-
         essarily assume an all water path.
         
              In  addition to LORAN-C Geographic conversions, MARNAV also
         provides the ability to navigation  from  one  pair  of  LORAN-C
         delays  to  another  pair  within  the  same  chain.  In  cruise
         planning, waypoint data is generally listed during the  planning
         stage  and  since  these data are already available it is conve-
         nient  to  use  them  for  calculating  heading   and   distance
         information. In addition it is  also possible to calculate head-
         ing and distance information from Latitude/Longitude data over a
         rhumb  line  course.  These  programs  do  not parallel programs
         available within typical LORAN-C  units  available  today  since
         those  computer  navigation  features  calculate  from  measured
         delays at present position.
         
              Since the Navigation solutions are available it only seemed
         logical  to include a Time/Speed/Distance function. The simplest
         data entry scheme appeared to be the query for each entry with a
         calculated result for the one not entered.

         C & E Associates has chosen to use the Shareware concept to dis-
         tribute this program. This is good for us in  that  it  contains
         many  of  the costs associated with a retail sales effort. It is
         good for you since it allows you to make an  intelligent  buying
         decision  by  trying  the  program to make sure it does what you
         want before you spend your money. It does however bring with  it
         a legal and moral commitment to buy (Register) the program after
         you have tried it and found it to be to your liking. The authors
         of  Shareware  receive  NO  money from the distribution of their
         efforts until you, the user, register it.  If  you  believe  the
         effort  that  goes  into writing a program such as this deserves
         the thirty-five dollar registration fee then please  register by
         sending  your  check  along with the form included at the end of
         the documentation. 
         
         No program features have been "held back" until you register the
         program.  When you register, you will receive a copy of the lat-
         est version of the program as well as discounts  on  any  future
         program  upgrades.  In addition, you will be kept informed about
         several other programs in development on related subjects. Prog-
         gram support will be provided to both non-registered and regist-
         ered users using Compuserve Mail addressed to  Edward J. Panner,
         (72717,1612) or by U.S.Mail addressed to Edward J. Panner at the
         registration address.
 
         This program is produced by  a  member  of  the  Association  of
         Shareware  professionals  (ASP). ASP wants to make sure that the
         shareware principal works for you. If you are unable to  resolve
         a  shareware related problem with a ASP member by contacting the
         member directly, ASP may be able to help. The ASP Ombudsman  can
         help  you  resolve  a dispute or problem with an ASP member, but
         does not provide technical support for members' products. Please
         write  to  the  ASP  Ombudsman  at 545 Grover Road, Muskegon, MI
         49442 or send a Compuserve message via Compuserve  Mail  to  ASP
         Ombudsman 70007,3536. 
         
         Additional  information about the legalities of Shareware may be
         found in the appendix to this documentation. 
 
         MARNAV has a data base of thirteen files, one for  each  of  the
         thirteen chains world wide. The Shareware version is distributed
         with only one of these, the Pacific Coast Chain (GRI 9940) which
         will  let  you  try all of the programs features. In addition to
         these data files, one file is maintained to indicate the  Active
         Chain  (The chain you are currently using). When you first bring
         up MARNAV, it will read this active chain file and then the data
         for  the  indicated  chain. It is necessary that the program and
         all of the data files be kept in the same  directory  since  the
         program  looks for its data files in whatever directory you were
         in when you first brought up the program!
 
 
         MARNAV                   Documentation                   Page- 3
 
 
         
         The first screen gives the title and copyright data as well as a
         message  indicating what Active GRI data has been loaded. At the
         bottom of the screen is the main  menu.  You  will  be  able  to
         return  to  this  menu from virtually anywhere in the program by
         pressing the <HOME> key. In some cases you may also use the  <M>
         key  as  indicated  on the screen at that time. Each of the menu
         selections will be discussed below. Use the arrow keys  to  move
         around  the  menu selections. When the blinking cursor is at the
         end of any menu selection, the <RETURN>  key  will  select  that
         menu choice.
         
                                    Section II
         
                                 LORAN >> LAT/LON-
         
         As  the  menu  suggests,  when you make this choice, the program
         will convert Loran delay data  to  Latitude/Longitude  position.
         You  may  enter  delay data for any two secondaries. The program
         will not only calculate and report your Latitude/Longitude posi-
         tion  but will also calculate the remaining secondary delays for
         that position. This may at times be very useful since  secondar-
         ies do fail and it may be necessary to choose another.
         
         A  number  of  comments  are in order at this point. Since Loran
         positioning depends on the intersection of two Hyperbolic  delay
         lines,  there  are two valid intersections with the same delays.
         These are usually far enough apart so they do  not  confuse  the
         user but the computer does not know which one you are interested
         in and so may well calculate the other position. To avoid  this,
         it  is  necessary  to  provide  the computer with an approximate
         latitude and longitude position. Generally anything within a few
         hundred  miles  is  close enough. (2 to 3 degrees) Those are the
         numbers appearing at the top right of this screen. They  may  be
         changed by pressing <END> in the conversion routines or by using
         the utilities and that will be discussed in a later section.
         
         Notice that the Latitude/Longitude  data  is  printed  in  three
         formats: Degrees and decimal Degrees; Degrees, Minutes and deci-
         mal Minutes; Degrees, Minutes, Seconds and decimal Seconds. This
         is  done since different charts and maps have grids given in any
         one of these three formats depending on the scale.
 
         In  normal  geographic  position  data, West Longitude and South
         Latitude are negative values. In order  to  avoid  the  inconve-
         nience of worrying about the sign of these numbers, the quadrant
         data near the top center of the  screen  defines  the  quadrants
         which  are defined with positive values. For example, the United
         States is in the North latitude quadrant and the West  Longitude
         quadrant. Consequently, these Lat/Lon numbers are given as posi-
         tive values. The quadrants selected may also be changed  in  the
         same way as are the approximate latitude and longitude by press-
         ing the <END> key in the conversion routines.
 

         MARNAV                   Documentation                   Page- 4
 
 
         
         If the entered delays are unrealistically far from the  Approxi-
         mate Lat/Lon entries you will get a message:
         
                  NO USEFUL SOLUTION-CHECK INPUT DATA". 
                                                       Press any  key  to
         return to the Main Menu.
         
         We  will  defer  discussion  of the "INCLUDED CORRECTION" column
         until the Utilities are discussed in a later section.
         
                                    Section III
         
                                  LAT/LON >> LORAN
         
         This menu choice lets you convert Lat/Lon data to Loran  delays.
         The  Quadrant data and the Approximate Lat/Lon have already been
         discussed in the previous section. Also discussed in  that  sec-
         tion  were  the three formats used for Lat/Lon data output. Data
         may also be input in any of these three formats and the  compute
         will calculate the remaining two forms. This is a useful feature
         if you need to convert from one format  to  another  when  using
         different scale charts.
         
         If you enter data as follows:
                   42.62 it will be accepted as format 1
         Format 2 may be entered in any of these ways:
                   43/45.2 or 43:45.2 or 43,45.2 or 43 45.2
         It  does not matter if you type a , or a / or a space or a colon
         as the delimiter, on the screen each of these forms would appear
         as 43/45.2.
         
         Format  3  allows  the  same  delimiters  and  the data might be
         entered as follows:
                  43/50/34.6 or 43:50:34.6 or 43,50,34.6 or 43 50 34.6
         
         As  before,  no  matter  how you enter it, on the screen it will
         look like the first example 43/50/34.6.
         
         Once the Lat/Lon data is entered the Approximate Lat/Lon data is
         temporarily  changed to conform and the calculation is completed
         for all of the secondaries in the chain.
 
         CAUTION!  JUST BECAUSE THE COMPUTER TELLS YOU WHAT THE DELAY FOR
         THAT POSITION WILL BE, IT MAY BE THAT YOU ARE SO FAR FROM A SEC-
         ONDARY STATION THAT YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RECEIVE IT!
         
         As  mentioned  in  the previous section, the INCLUDED CORRECTION
         column will be discussed later.

                                    Section IV
         
                                 BEARING/DISTANCE
         
         The Bearing/Distance option  will  calculate  the  heading  from
         point  A to point B, it will give the distance in Nautical miles
         and the reciprocal heading. (The  heading  from  B  to  A).  The
         points  may  be specified in either Lat/Lon or Loran delays. One
         may defined in one way while the second is defined in the other.
         If,  when the cursor is at the LOP1 (Delay 1 or Line of Position
         1), you press the <ENTER>  key  the  program  assumes  you  will
         specify  the position in Lat/Lon coordinates. The cursor is then
         positioned on the ENTER LATITUDE line.
         
         If you enter either position in Loran delays the  Lat/Lon  posi-
         tion  is  calculated;  If,  however,  you  enter the position in
         Lat/Lon coordinates, the Loran delays will  not  be  calculated.
         This section should require no further discussion.
         
                                    Section V
         
                               SPEED/TIME/DISTANCE
         
         Little  comment  is  required  for  this  choice.  The  computer
         calculates the relationship between these three variables. Enter
         any  two  and  it will calculate the third. Simply press <ENTER>
         for the one you want the solution for. If  the  distance  is  in
         Nautical  miles, the speed given will be knots, or conversely if
         speed is entered in knots, calculated distance will be in nauti-
         cal  miles.  IF speed is miles per hour distance will be statute
         miles.
         
         If time is being calculated, the result is given in  both  Hours
         and decimal hours as well as hours and minutes. If time is being
         entered the same formats as discussed in Section III for degrees
         and  minutes, etc. hold for time, which may be entered in hours,
         minutes and seconds using the same delimiters of "/"  ","    ":"
         or space.
 
                                    Section VI
         
                                    GRI UTILITIES
         
         The GRI Utilities allow you to enter data for a new Loran Chain,
         let you edit all of the data for Loran Chains you  already  have
         in  files,  provide  an additional way to change the Initial GRI
         (The GRI which comes up when you load the program), let you  add
         correction  factors  for  each secondary and will print the data
         file for any Loran Chain.

         When  you  select the EDIT option you have the choice of editing
         the data currently in memory, reading a new GRI file for edit or
         starting  over  to  enter a new Loran Chain. Editing is straight
         forward. You can move around the data  screen  using  the  arrow
         keys. If you press the <ENTER> key the program accepts the entry
         as it appears on the screen. To edit a data  entry,  the  entire
         entry  must  be  retyped.  When you have finished correcting the
         data field, press <END> to return to the menu bar.  If  you  are
         satisfied  with the field as it exists, move the cursor to WRITE
         FILE-, press <ENTER> and the data will be written to disk.
         
         If you selected the CHANGE GRI- option from the  EDIT  menu  the
         new  data will replace the data you have been using. You can now
         exit Edit and work in the new GRI or, you may want to edit  that
         data  and  write  it  to the files. If, at that time you want to
         change back to the GRI you had previously, you will have to  use
         the CHANGE GRI- option again and call for the desired Chain.
         
         If  you  are  entering  data for a new Loran Chain, latitude and
         longitude data must be entered in the degree and decimal  degree
         mode only. Double check all of your entries carefully because an
         error here produces erroneous output. When all the data has been
         entered, write the data to disk using the WRITE FILE- option.
         
         When you want to change the Initial GRI, select that option from
         the Utilities menu bar. The cursor will move to the  upper  left
         portion  of  the screen. You then enter the new GRI designation,
         along with the Latitude and  Longitude  quadrants  you  will  be
         working  in.  (See Section II). When you press <ENTER> after the
         longitude quadrant selection, the new GRI  file  will  be  read.
         After that whenever you start the program, the data for the Ini-
         tial GRI will be loaded automatically.
         
                                    SECTION VII
         
                                 CORRECTION FACTOR
         
         Loran calculations and their accuracy depend on the  propagation
         velocity  of radio waves. Unfortunately the propagation velocity
         is not the same over all types of terrain so the delay time to a
         given  point  may  be  slightly  different than it is to another
         point whose distance from the secondary station is  exactly  the
         same.  While the errors incurred are not large, they can lead to
         position errors of one quarter to one third of a mile.
         
         If you get the exact geographic location of  some  fixed  object
         such  as  a bridge, a building or a point of land you can calcu-
         late the theoretical Loran delays for that  point.  If  you  now
         measure  the actual delays to that point using a Loran, the dif-
         ference between the calculated delays and  the  measured  delays
         can be entered as correction factors.
 
 
         MARNAV                   Documentation                   Page- 7
 
 
         These correction factors will be approximately correct  for  all
         Loran data in the general area where they were determined. These
         correction factors will have a negative value because the propa-
         gation   velocity   of  radio  waves  is  decreased  by  surface
         anomalies. These correction factors may be entered for each sec-
         ondary  using  the  editor in the GRI UTILITIES mode. It is this
         propagation velocity problem that results in the Absolute  Posi-
         tion  Error  in Lorans even though Repeatable Accuracy may be as
         little as 50 feet. The correction factors help to  resolve  this
         difficulty when precise positioning is important.
         
         Do  not  use  the chart position of markers or bouys from marine
         charts since their geographic position  is  often  significantly
         different  from  their  position on the chart. Land based points
         whose position is determined by surveys are  more  suitable  for
         calculating correction factors.
         
                                   Section VIII
         
                                HARD COPY-OFF or ON
         
         It  is  often convenient to have a hard copy of your conversions
         or, more often, the calculations of heading and  distance.  This
         is especially true when you are planning a boat cruise since you
         can plan your entire trip in the comfort of your home or  office
         and  have a printout of the results. The HARD COPY OFF/ON option
         of the main menu toggles the printer on  and  off  whenever  the
         cursor is positioned at this choice and you press <ENTER>. After
         each of your conversions or calculations, the results are  auto-
         matically printed.

                                 Shareware
         
         Copyright laws apply to both Shareware and commercial  software,
         and the copyright holder retains all rights, with a few specific
         exceptions as stated below. The author specifically  grants  the
         right to copy and distribute the software, either to all or to a
         specific group. 
         
          Shareware is a distribution method, not a type of software. You
         should  find  software  that  suits  your  needs and pocketbook,
         whether it's Commercial or Shareware. The Shareware system makes
         fitting  your  needs easier, because you can try before you buy.
         And because the overhead is low, prices are low also.  Shareware
         has  the  ultimate  money-back guarantee -- if you don't use the
         product, you don't pay  for  it.  Shareware  distribution  gives
         users  a  chance  to try software before buying it. If you try a
         Shareware program and continue using it,  you  are  expected  to
         register. 
         
         MARNAV.EXE is a "shareware program" and is provided at no charge
         to the user for evaluation. Feel free  to  share  it  with  your
         friends,  but  do not give it away altered or as part of another
         program. The essence of "user-supported" software is to  provide
         personal  computer  users  with  quality  software  without high
         prices, and yet to provide incentive for programmers to continue
         to  develop  new  products.  If you find this program useful and
         continue  to use it after a  reasonable  trial period,  you must
         make a registration payment of $35.00 to C & E Associates 
         
          The registration fee will license one copy for use on  any  one
         computer at any one time. You must treat this software just like
         a book. An example is that this software may be used by any num-
         ber of people and may be freely moved from one computer location
         to another, so long as there is no possibility of it being  used
         at one location while it's being used at another. Just as a book
         cannot be read by two different persons at the same time. 
         
         Anyone distributing MARNAV.EXE for any kind of remuneration must
         first  contact  C  &  E  Associates  at  the  address  below for
         authorization. This authorization will be automatically  granted
         to  distributors  recognized  by  the  (ASP)  as adhering to its
         guidelines for shareware distributors, and such distributors may
         begin offering MARNAV.EXE  immediately (However C & E Associates
         must still be advised  so  that  the  distributor  can  be  kept
         up-to-date with the latest version.)

         You are  encouraged  to  pass a copy of MARNAV.EXE along to your
         friends for evaluation. Please encourage them to register  their
         copy  if  they  find  that they can use it. All registered users
         will receive a copy of the latest version of the MARNAV programs
         as well as the data files for all existing LORAN chains.
 
         The  distribution of MARNAV.EXE by shareware vendors  and  other
         distributors of user supported software  is  hereby  authorized.
         MARNAV.EXE  is  copyrighted  software and is not placed  in  the
         public domain but rather is entered in the Shareware  market  so
         that potential users may insure that it meets their needs.
         
         The registration fee  for the program  is a only  $35.00.   Reg-
         istered users will automatically receive  software  support  and
