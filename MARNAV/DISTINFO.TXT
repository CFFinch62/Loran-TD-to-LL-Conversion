    Short Description:
    ------------------
    
       A program to convert GPS (Lat/Lon) coordinates to LORAN C
       delays and vice versa. The program will also calculate heading
       and distance from point "A" to point "B" with the location of the
       points specified either as Lat/Lon or LORAN delays. It also per-
       forms Time/Speed/Distance calculations and provides hard copy for
       all functions. Registered users are provided with data files
       covering all LORAN chains world-wide. An editor allows the add-
       ition of new chains.
    
    Long Description:
    -----------------
              There is an increasing need for software which will convert
         GPS (Lat/Lon) data to LORAN-C delay  coordinates and vice-versa
         for  the  purpose of adding LORAN-C data to the many charts and
         maps, both land and marine which are published  without  this
         information.  In addition to the LORAN to LAT/LON, MARNAV also
         calculates all delays for a given geographic location thus allow-
         ing a shift to another slave in the event of technical difficulty
         or to double check a position.
         
              All  LORAN-C Chains for which data is currently available
         are included for registered users. The data used is based on
         information from the UNITED STATES COAST GUARD, Department of
         Transportation as published in COMDTINST-M16562.3 (Old CG-462).
         
              In  addition to LORAN-C Geographic conversions, MARNAV also
         provides the ability to navigate from one pair of LORAN-C delays
         to another pair within the same chain. In cruise planning,
         waypoint data is generally listed during the planning stage and
         since these data are already available it is convenient to use
         them for calculating heading and distance information. In
         addition it is also possible to calculate heading and distance
         information from Latitude/Longitude data over a rhumb line
         course.These features do not parallel programs available within
         typical LORAN-C units available today since those programs 
         calculate from measured delays at present position.
         
              Since the Navigation solutions are available it only seemed
         logical to include a Time/Speed/Distance function. The simplest
         data entry scheme appeared to be the query for each entry with a
         calculated result for the one not entered.

              Hard copy is optionally available for all calculations to
         facilitate cruise and trip planning.  The GRI data base may be
         edited and delay correction factors may be entered. New GRI data
         can also be entered.

       C & E Associates is a small software company owned and operated by
       Edward J. Panner. In addition to MARNAV, we also offer the prog-
       ram FISHTIME which predicts the most favorable times for hunting
       and fishing based on time of day and position of the moon.
       
       We also offer a program called GOLFHCAP. This program calculates
       handicaps for golf leagues using the USGA Slope System. The prog-
       ram also maintains records and prints all necessary forms for golf
       associations.
