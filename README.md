# Loran-TD-to-LL-Conversion
A few tools for the purpose of converting postion coordinates between Loarn TD and GPS Lat/Lon

These programs are OLD! Some run only in DOS.

1. GPTOTD - made by National Ocean Service (DOS) {Fortran source inluded}
2. MARNAV - Commercial (DOS)
3. POSAID2 - made by USCG (DOS) {Pascal Source included}
4. TD2LL - made by British Researchers (Win 32) {VS C++ 6.0 source included}

Along with the ASF and research papers their is enough informaiton if any one is trying to write their own code to 
make this conversion.
