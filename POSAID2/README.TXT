This program is for converting Loran-C TD's to Latitude and Longitude.  
The conversion is based on the Sodano (1965) method taken from McCullough,J,
et al, "Loran-C Latitude-Longitude Conversion At Sea Programming Considerations".
The original reference for the conversion is: Sodano, E.M., 1965, 
General non-iterative solution of the inverse and direct geodetic problems: 
Bulletin Geodesique, annee, Nouvelle Serie, no. 75.  

The Loran-C station positions are in the text file chain.inf.  
The positions are given in WGS 84 coordinates.  If the Loran-C configuration
changes this file would have to be updated.  It is been updated using 
the latest version of COMDTINST M16562.4A, "Specification of the 
Transmitted Loran-C Signal", USCG 1994

The program also does some 
coordinate conversions between WGS84,WGS72,NAD83 and NAD27. 
Note that the answers for NAD83 and WGS84 are identical.  
The ellipsoids are virtually the same so for the ellipsoid conversion 
algorithms used here the results are identical.  The NAD 27 conversion
algorithms are based on an approximation of the NAD27 spheriod for the 
whole continent.  Accuracy will varying from 5-10 meters.  For a precise 
NAD27 conversion go to: http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/
